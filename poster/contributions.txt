Code Contributions:
- In terms of the scripts written, the majority of the code was written by
  Eroatus. markogonzales and ZhichaoMa both helped with testing and debugging
  the code and determining whether the results were reasonable. The data used
  within the simulator (documented within conditions.py) was collected by both
  Eroatus (temperature fluctuations for the boundary) and markogonzales (all of
  the material properties).

Poster Contributions:
- The poster was drafted by both markogonzales and ZhichaoMa, incrementally add-
  ing to the file as more results were provided by Eroatus' work on the coding
  side of the project. The methodology portion was improved upon and detailed by
  Eroatus to reflect the code, and final editing was completed by the team as a
  whole.
