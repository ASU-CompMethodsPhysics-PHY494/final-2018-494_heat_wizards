Housing Structural Heat Analysis

494 Heat Wizards:

Our team investigated the temperature distribution within a basic house over a
two day period during summer and winter by simulating the heat equation in 1D
and 2D for various materials and wall thicknesses. The problem is particularly
interesting in the context of living in Arizona as the data will indicate what
kinds of insulations and wall thicknesses produce the best results for maintain-
ing a comfortable internal house temperature without the aid of air condition-
ing. The code used to analyze the heat equation consists of a 1D and 2D version
of the Crank-Nicolson algorithm, producing temperature distributions that are
then plotted in a convenient and readable manner. The simulations are run for
the various materials and wall thicknesses in 1D before being processed into two
sets of plots: one comparing the effects of each insulation material and another
comparing the effects of wall thickness. The temperature distributions will de-
pict to what degree the selected parameters allow heat to disperse through the
walls of the house. In the future, the implementation will be extended to 3D
while accounting for possible structural integrities, such as windows and doors.
Additionally, realistic house layouts will be analyzed, accounting for internal
walls/rooms.
